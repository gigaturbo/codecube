**Codecube allows to use `lua` code in Minetest to build anything you want**

This game is mainly based on the [CodeBlock](https://content.minetest.net/packages/giga-turbo/codeblock/) mod for the programming interface. This game provides a flat world and a few other settings and limitations for a better programming experience.

## Quick start

### Run your first program

1. Install the game and create a new world
3. Right click with ![drone_poser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/dp.png) tool on a block to place the drone, choose `stairs.lua` then left click with ![drone_poser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/dp.png) to start the drone

### Write your first program

1. Right click with ![drone_setter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/ds.png) tool to open the `lua` editor
2. Create a new file with the `new file` field and write some code on the main window
3. Click `load and exit` to load your code in the drone
4. Right click with ![drone_poser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/dp.png) tool on a block and run the code with a left click on ![drone_poser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/dp.png)
5. Read the [Lua API](https://github.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/blob/master/doc/api.md#lua-api) in `doc/api.md` to know which commands and blocks you can use

### Explore and tweak

- More built-in examples are available, just open the editor and choose an example to run
- User `codelevel` can be adjusted to tweak drone performance and capacities, see [permisisons](https://github.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/blob/master/doc/api.md#codelevel) and [chat commands](https://github.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/blob/master/doc/api.md#chat-commands)
