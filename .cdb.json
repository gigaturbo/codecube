This game provides a flat world and a few other settings and limitations for a better programming experience.\n\n**License:** AGPLv3   \n**Credits:** inspired by [Gnancraft](http://gnancraft.net/), [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/), [Visual Bots](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Nigel/vbots/), [TurtleMiner](https://content.minetest.net/packages/BirgitLachner/turtleminer/), [basic_robot](https://github.com/ac-minetest/basic_robot)\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codecube/master/screenshot.png)\n\n## Quick start\n\n### Run your first program\n\n1. Install the game and create a new world\n3. Right click with ![drone_poser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/dp.png) tool on a block to place the drone, choose `stairs.lua` then left click with ![drone_poser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/dp.png) to start the drone\n\n### Write your first program\n\n1. Right click with ![drone_setter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/ds.png) tool to open the `lua` editor\n2. Create a new file with the `new file` field and write some code on the main window\n3. Click `load and exit` to load your code in the drone\n4. Right click with ![drone_poser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/dp.png) tool on a block and run the code with a left click on ![drone_poser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/master/doc/dp.png)\n5. Read the [Lua API](https://github.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/blob/master/doc/api.md#lua-api) in `doc/api.md` to know which commands and blocks you can use\n\n### Explore and tweak\n\n- More built-in examples are available, just open the editor and choose an example to run\n- User `codelevel` can be adjusted to tweak drone performance and capacities, see [permisisons](https://github.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/blob/master/doc/api.md#codelevel) and [chat commands](https://github.com/gigaturbo/codeblock/blob/master/doc/api.md#chat-commands)",
