# Releasing CodeBlock

CodeBlock is the main project and releases on its own cadence. Nothing here
touches the `codecube` game: the game adopts a release when it chooses to, with
`release-codecube`, and the two are no longer a lockstep dance.

Everything below happens in `mods/codeblock`, which is a checkout of the
`codeblock` repository, branch `master`.

Do not start until `release-check codeblock` reports ready, or you have done its
checks yourself. This skill is the procedure; that agent is the gate.

## 1. Decide the version

Semantic, and the question that decides it is **whether existing player programs
break**. Programs are data written by players and stored in worlds; nothing can
migrate them.

Anything in this list is major:

- a name in `lib/api.lua` removed, renamed, or given different arguments
- `color()`, `round()` or similar changing what they return for the same input
- a block name changing (`wools.wool_red` → `wools.red` was one)
- a previously-allowed construct being refused
- relicensing, which breaks redistributors rather than players

v1.0.0 is major for several of these at once.

## 2. The release

```bash
cd mods/codeblock
```

- `CHANGELOG.md` — add the version heading, in the existing `- [x]` style.
  **Lead with what breaks**, then additions, then fixes, then known limitations
  as `- [ ]`. Someone upgrading reads the first section and stops.
- `mod.conf` — confirm `min_minetest_version` still matches what the code needs.
  Only raise it when something actually requires it; an honest floor widens the
  audience. Do not add `max_minetest_version`: the engine ignores it and
  ContentDB uses it to hide the package. Confirm `depends` still names
  `vector3`.
- Regenerate the reference if anything in `lib/api.lua` changed:
  `lua scripts/gen_docs.lua`, or boot with `codeblock_gen_docs = true` and copy
  the result out of the world directory (mod security blocks writing into the mod
  directory). `lua scripts/gen_docs.lua --check` must then exit 0.
- Regenerate `.cdb.json`: `bash scripts/gen_cdb_json.sh`. It embeds `README.md`,
  so any README edit needs this — and **nothing checks it for you here**; the
  equivalent script in the game is diffed by `check_game.sh`, this one is not.
- `ROADMAP.md` and `TODO.md` **in this directory** — strike what this release
  closed. Or ask `project-manager` to, which is cheaper and more honest. The
  reasoning behind each item is in this mod's own audit, `.audit/audit.html`
  beside them; the game's four documents are a separate record and are not
  touched by a mod release.
- `.gitattributes` — confirm nothing added since the last release will ship in
  the archive. Nothing in CI checks it.
- Commit, then **push**: `git push origin master`.
- Tag: `git tag -a v<version> -m "v<version>"` and `git push origin v<version>`.

## 3. Verify

- CI green on the tagged commit itself: `luacheck`, the six standalone specs and
  `docs are generated from the code`. Check `head_sha`; a green run on an earlier
  commit tells you nothing.
- The in-engine suite via `run-tests`. Note what it needs: it boots the **game**
  (`--gameid codecube`), so an in-engine run requires a `codecube` checkout even
  though the mod is what is being released. `0 failed`, `0 xpass`.
- A fresh clone of the mod alone, which is how a standalone install gets it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gigaturbo/codeblock.git /tmp/cb-check
ls /tmp/cb-check/lib/       # the new work is actually present
```

## 4. ContentDB

The `codeblock` package at <https://content.luanti.org>, uploaded on its own.

- The long description comes from `.cdb.json`, generated from `README.md`.
  Regenerate before uploading or the listing goes stale.
- Screenshots load from raw GitHub URLs on `master`. GitHub currently redirects
  an old default-branch name, so a wrong branch may *look* fine — do not rely on
  that.
- Confirm the licence field matches the `LICENSE` file: AGPL-3.0-only.

## 5. After

- Watch CI on the tagged commit; a red build on a tag is worth fixing
  immediately rather than after someone downloads it.
- Ask `project-manager` to update this mod's audit, changelog and roadmap — the
  main record of the two, and the one whose phase numbers commit messages cite.
- **Do not bump the game's submodule as part of this.** Adopting the release is
  a separate decision, taken with the game's documentation update, and it is
  `release-codecube`'s job.

## Things that have gone wrong here before

- `max_minetest_version` left at an old value, hiding a working package from
  everyone on a current release. The engine never enforced it, so nothing local
  ever failed.
- A limit shipped undocumented, because the check that every codelevel limit has
  a row in `doc/api.md` matched by name prefix. It matches by table shape now,
  and `gen_docs.lua --check` is what enforces it.
- `.cdb.json` regenerated on a checkout whose line endings differed, producing a
  spurious diff.
